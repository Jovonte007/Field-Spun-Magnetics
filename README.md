ðŸ“„ Field-Spun Magnetics: Alternating Current Geometry Induced Spin

Author: Jovonte Marcellino
Date: June 2025

ðŸ”¬ Description

This project presents a novel concept: generating rotational magnetic behavior (similar to that produced by alternating current) using only direct currentâ€”through the physical geometry of opposing coil windings.

By stacking a clockwise coil with a counterclockwise coil over a conductive core (like copper), and applying DC power, a spatially-encoded magnetic waveform is formed. This configuration may induce spin in a suspended or levitating magnet without the need for mechanical parts or electronic switching.

ðŸ§ª Experiment Summary

Core: Copper cylinder

Primary Coil: Clockwise wound

Secondary Coil: Counterclockwise wound (on top of primary)

Power Source: DC (from PWM or regulated supply)

Objective: Detect induced magnetic rotation or oscillation

Expected Outcome: Magnet placed above or inside the structure may begin to spin

ðŸ§  Why It Matters

This project opens the possibility of:

Solid-state magnetic spin systems

Coil-geometry-based waveform generation

Quantum-aligned magnetic experiments

Low-energy, non-mechanical propulsion or motion
